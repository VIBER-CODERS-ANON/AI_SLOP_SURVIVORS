# WoodlandJoe Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Custom Aggro System Removed
**Problem:** WoodlandJoe had custom aggro and wandering logic that bypassed the standardized `EnemyAIBehavior` component, causing inconsistencies and potential conflicts with game systems.

**Solution:** Removed all custom aggro/wandering code and let the built-in AI system handle everything.

### 2. Move Speed Compounding Bug
**Problem:** After evolving to WoodlandJoe and applying MXP buffs, move speed would compound exponentially.

**Solution:** The `ChatterEntityManager.apply_upgrades_to_entity()` already had the fix with proper base stat caching.

### 3. Sprite Direction Bug
**Problem:** Used `sprite.flip_h` which bypasses the scale multiplier system.

**Solution:** Implemented proper scale-based direction flipping that accounts for MXP buffs:

```gdscript
func _face_movement_direction():
    if not sprite:
        return
    
    if velocity.x != 0:
        # Calculate actual scale including MXP buffs
        var actual_scale = base_scale * scale_multiplier
        # Sprite faces RIGHT by default
        if velocity.x > 0:
            sprite.scale.x = actual_scale
        else:
            sprite.scale.x = -actual_scale
```

## Changes Made

1. **Removed custom variables:**
   - `@export var aggro_radius`
   - `var is_aggroed`
   - `var wander_timer`
   - `var wander_change_interval`

2. **Removed custom functions:**
   - `_entity_physics_process()` override
   - `_check_aggro_range()`
   - `_handle_wandering()`
   - `_randomize_wander_target()`
   - `_find_player()` helper

3. **AI Configuration:**
   - Now uses standard `ai_behavior` component configured in `_setup_npc()`
   - Settings match the original behavior (1500 aggro radius, 250 wander radius, etc.)

## Result

WoodlandJoe now behaves consistently with all other enemies while maintaining his unique characteristics:
- Still a slow, powerful juggernaut
- Still has screen-wide detection range
- Still drops extra XP on death
- Now properly integrates with MXP buffs and game systems
- No more exponential speed scaling with buffs

## Key Takeaway

Always use the standardized systems provided by the base classes. Custom implementations can cause bugs and conflicts with other game systems, especially upgrade/buff systems.
