class_name PercentageBoonTemplate

## Template for percentage-based boons using MORE (multiplicative) scaling
## These boons provide percentage increases that compound when stacked
## Copy this file and rename for your specific percentage boon

# Configuration
const BASE_PERCENTAGE = 0.05  # 5% base (as decimal)

    # MORE SCALING (Multiplicative - Compounds with each stack):
    # player.some_stat *= (1.0 + multiplier)
    # Example: 100 * 1.05 * 1.05 * 1.05 = 115.76 (3 stacks of 5%)
    
    # INCREASED SCALING (Additive - Linear growth):
    # player.some_stat_bonus += multiplier
    # Then in getter: return base_stat * (1.0 + some_stat_bonus)
    # Example: 100 * (1.0 + 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.05) = 115 (3 stacks of 5%)
    
    # Common examples:
    
    # Attack Speed (MORE):
    # var weapon = player.get_primary_weapon()
    # if weapon:
    #     weapon.attack_speed_multiplier *= (1.0 + multiplier)
    
    # Area of Effect (MORE):
    # player.area_of_effect *= (1.0 + multiplier)
    
    # Damage Multiplier (MORE):
    # player.damage_multiplier *= (1.0 + multiplier)
    
    # Movement Speed (Increased):
    # player.movement_speed_bonus += multiplier
    
    # Critical Damage (MORE):
    # player.crit_damage *= (1.0 + multiplier)
    
    # Experience Gain (MORE):
    # player.experience_multiplier *= (1.0 + multiplier)
    
    # Always print confirmation with clear language

## Balance Guidelines for Percentage Boons:
##
## MORE Scaling (Multiplicative):
## - Attack Speed: 10-20% base (can break animations if too high)
## - Area of Effect: 5-10% base (visual impact)
## - Damage: 5-15% base (primary scaling)
## - Critical Damage: 20-50% base (conditional)
##
## INCREASED Scaling (Additive):
## - Movement Speed: 5-10% base (map control)
## - Resistances: 10-20% base (damage reduction)
## - Resource Generation: 10-25% base (mana/stamina)
##
## MORE scaling becomes VERY powerful when stacked!
## Example: 10% MORE with 5 stacks = 1.1^5 = 1.61 (61% total increase)
##
## Remember: These percentages are for COMMON rarity
## Magic = 2x, Rare = 3x, Epic = 4x automatically
