# Forsen Boss Implementation Guide

## Overview

The Forsen boss is a complex, chat-interactive boss with multiple phases and unique mechanics. This guide documents the implementation details and architectural decisions made during development.

## Key Features

1. **Chat Interaction**: The boss's Summon Swarm ability responds to Twitch chat emotes
2. **Two Distinct Abilities**:
   - **Periodic Horse Charge**: Every 15 seconds, spawns 5 horses that charge once then despawn
   - **HORSEN Transformation**: At 20% HP, transforms into HORSEN with completely different mechanics
3. **Boss Buff**: Grants all chatters a 1% chance to summon warriors when typing Forsen emotes
4. **Summoned Entities**: Creates Ugandan Warriors and Horse enemies

## Implementation Structure

### 1. ForsenBoss Class (`entities/enemies/bosses/forsen_boss.gd`)

**Extends**: `BaseBoss`

**Key Properties**:
- Base Health: 700 HP
- Base Damage: 20
- Movement Speed: 100
- Attack Type: Melee
- Transformation Threshold: 20% HP

**Special Mechanics**:
- **Summon Swarm**: 10-second channeled ability with 25-second cooldown (chat-reactive)
- **Periodic Horse Charge**: Timer-based ability (15s cooldown) that spawns 5 charging horses
- **HORSEN Transformation**: Complete stat and behavior change at 20% HP (one-time phase change)

**Chat Integration**:
- Connects to `GameController.chat_message_received` signal during Summon Swarm
- Tracks users who have already summoned to prevent spam
- 30% chance to summon warrior per Forsen emote

### 2. Summon Swarm Ability (`systems/ability_system/abilities/summon_swarm_ability.gd`)

**Type**: Channeled, Self-targeted ability

**Key Features**:
- Disables movement during channel
- Visual feedback with pulsing red effect
- Tracks summoned warriors per user
- Reports to action feed for player awareness

**Chat Detection**:
- Monitors for Forsen-related emotes: ["forsen", "forsene", "forsenE", "OMEGALUL", "LULW", "ZULUL", "Pepega"]
- Case-insensitive matching

### 3. Ugandan Warrior (`entities/enemies/ugandan_warrior.gd`)

**Extends**: `BaseCreature`

**Stats**:
- Health: 1 HP (dies in one hit)
- Movement Speed: 250 (very fast)
- Explosion Damage: 100% of max HP

**Unique Behaviors**:
- Yells "GWA GWA GWA GWA!" on spawn with visual text
- Automatically aggros on player
- Explodes on contact using Suicide Bomb ability
- Awards 1 XP on death

### 4. Suicide Bomb Ability (`systems/ability_system/abilities/suicide_bomb_ability.gd`)

**Type**: Self-targeted AoE ability

**Mechanics**:
- 1-second telegraph with red circle
- Entity grows and turns red during channel
- Damage based on entity's max HP
- Proper death attribution for kill feed

### 5. Horse Enemy (`entities/enemies/horse_enemy.gd`)

**Extends**: `BaseCreature`

**Stats**:
- Health: 100 HP
- Charge Damage: 50
- Charge Speed: 400

**Charge Mechanic**:
- 1-second lock-on preparation
- Charges in straight line through and past target
- Cannot change direction once charging
- Despawns after charge (no XP drops)

### 6. Boss Buff System Integration

**In BossBuffManager**:
- Added `forsen_warrior_summon_enabled` flag
- Monitors all chat messages for Forsen emotes
- 1% chance to spawn warrior near random chatter
- Warriors spawned this way are labeled as "Buff Warriors"

## Scene Files

All entities have corresponding `.tscn` files with proper node structure:
- Sprite/AnimatedSprite2D nodes
- CollisionShape2D with appropriate shapes
- Health UI for bosses

## Integration Points

### Boss Vote System
- Added to `boss_registry` in `BossVoteManager`
- Icon path points to Forsen sprite

### Game Controller
- `spawn_forsen_boss()` function follows same pattern as other bosses
- Creates nodes dynamically with proper hierarchy
- Uses boss spawn effect with purple portal

### Chat System
The implementation assumes a `chat_message_received` signal on GameController with parameters:
- `username: String`
- `message: String`
- `user_color: Color`

## Design Decisions

1. **Modular Abilities**: Summon Swarm is a standalone ability that can be reused
2. **Death Attribution**: All damage sources properly track original owner for kill feed
3. **Performance**: Chat listeners only active during relevant periods
4. **Visual Feedback**: Extensive use of tweens and particles for game feel

## Potential Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Chat Spam
**Solution**: Each user can only summon one warrior per Summon Swarm channel

### Issue: Too Many Warriors
**Solution**: Warriors have 1 HP and die easily, natural population control

### Issue: Performance with Many Entities
**Solution**: Warriors are lightweight with minimal AI, horses despawn quickly

## Testing Considerations

1. Test transformation at exactly 20% HP
2. Verify chat integration works with various emote capitalizations
3. Ensure proper cleanup when boss dies mid-channel
4. Test boss buff persistence across multiple spawns
5. Verify death attribution shows correct usernames

## Future Enhancements

1. Add more Forsen-specific dialogue lines
2. Implement horse sound effects via ElevenLabs
3. Add special effects for HORSEN transformation
4. Create unique sprites for all entities (currently using placeholders)
5. Add more variety to warrior spawn patterns

## Code Quality

- All classes follow established patterns from existing bosses
- Proper use of signals and callbacks
- No hardcoded values - uses exports where appropriate
- Follows naming conventions established in codebase
- Includes debug prints (commented out) for troubleshooting

## Bug Fixes

### Twitch Entity Spawning During Boss Vote (Fixed)
**Issue**: Twitch chat entities were spawning during the boss voting phase.

**Solution**: Added a check in `game_controller.gd`'s `_handle_chat_message()` function:
```gdscript
# Check if boss voting is active
if BossVoteManager.instance and BossVoteManager.instance.is_voting:
    # Don't spawn entities during boss vote
    return
```

This prevents entity spawning while still allowing vote commands (!vote1, !vote2, !vote3) to function properly during the voting phase.

### Forsen Boss Sprites Not Visible (Fixed)
**Issue**: Forsen's sprites were not visible in both the boss vote menu and in-game.

**Solution**: Updated asset paths to match actual filenames:
- Changed `forsen_sprite.png` → `forsen.png`
- Changed `horsen_sprite.png` → `horsen.png`

Files updated:
- `entities/enemies/bosses/forsen_boss.gd`
- `systems/boss_vote_manager.gd`
- `entities/enemies/bosses/forsen_boss.tscn`

### Twitch Chatters Unable to Vote (Fixed)
**Issue**: After preventing entity spawns during boss votes, chatters could no longer use !vote commands.

**Solution**: Restructured `_handle_chat_message()` to process vote commands BEFORE checking voting status:
```gdscript
# Boss Vote Commands - Always process these first, even during pause or voting
if msg_lower.begins_with("!vote"):
    _handle_vote_command(username, msg_lower)
    return

# ... other checks ...

# Check if boss voting is active
if BossVoteManager.instance and BossVoteManager.instance.is_voting:
    # Don't spawn entities during boss vote, but commands were already processed above
    return
```

This ensures vote commands work during voting while still preventing entity spawns.

## Latest Updates

### Horse Sprite Implementation
The horse enemies now use a proper animated spritesheet instead of placeholder sprites:

**Spritesheet Details**:
- File: `BespokeAssetSources/forsen/horsesprite.png`
- Dimensions: 53100x242 pixels 
- Frames: 150 frames (354x242 per frame)
- Animation: 30 FPS smooth galloping

**Implementation Features**:
1. **Programmatic Loading**: All 150 frames are loaded at runtime for efficiency
2. **Dynamic Animation Speed**:
   - Normal movement: 1.0x speed
   - Charge preparation: 0.3x speed (dramatic slow-motion)
   - Charging: 2.0x speed (intense gallop)
3. **Directional Sprites**: Horses flip horizontally based on movement direction
4. **Scene Simplification**: The .tscn file only contains the AnimatedSprite2D node; frames are created in code

**Code Implementation** (`horse_enemy.gd`):
```gdscript
func _setup_sprite():
    sprite = get_node_or_null("AnimatedSprite2D")
    var frames = SpriteFrames.new()
    var texture = load("res://BespokeAssetSources/forsen/horsesprite.png")
    
    frames.add_animation("run")
    frames.set_animation_speed("run", 30.0)
    
    for i in range(150):
        var atlas_texture = AtlasTexture.new()
        atlas_texture.atlas = texture
        atlas_texture.region = Rect2(i * 354, 0, 354, 242)
        frames.add_frame("run", atlas_texture)
    
    sprite.sprite_frames = frames
    sprite.play("run")
```
