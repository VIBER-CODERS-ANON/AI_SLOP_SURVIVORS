## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Creating Your First Ability

1. **Choose a template** from `ability_templates/` that matches your ability type
2. **Copy the template** to `systems/ability_system/abilities/your_ability.gd`
3. **Follow the TODOs** in the template to customize
4. **Use the checklist** to ensure nothing is missed
5. **Refer to the main guide** for detailed explanations

### Example: Creating a Fireball

```gdscript
# 1. Copy projectile_ability_template.gd to fireball_ability.gd
# 2. Update the _init() method:

func _init() -> void:
    ability_id = "fireball"
    ability_name = "Fireball"
    ability_description = "Launches a fiery projectile that explodes on impact"
    ability_tags = ["Fire", "Projectile", "AoE"]
    base_cooldown = 2.0
    resource_costs = {"mana": 15.0}
```

### Creating Your First Boon

1. **Choose a template** from `boon_templates/` that matches your boon type
2. **Copy the template** to `systems/boon_system/boons/your_boon.gd`
3. **Set base values** (these are Common rarity values)
4. **Add to boon pool** in `boon_manager.gd`
5. **Test at all rarities** using the checklist

### Example: Creating a Strength Boon

```gdscript
# 1. Copy stat_boon_template.gd to strength_boon.gd
# 2. Update the configuration:

const BASE_VALUE = 2.0  # +2 damage at Common

func _init():
    id = "strength"
    display_name = "Strength"
    base_type = "damage"
    icon_color = Color(1, 0.5, 0)  # Orange

func get_formatted_description() -> String:
    var value = get_effective_power(BASE_VALUE)
    return "+%.0f Base Damage" % value
```

### Creating Your First NPC

1. **Choose base class**: `BaseCreature` for standard NPCs, `BaseEvolvedCreature` for evolved forms
2. **Copy a template** from the Quick Reference guide
3. **Create the script** in `entities/enemies/your_npc.gd`
4. **Create the scene** in `entities/enemies/your_npc.tscn`
5. **Use the checklist** to ensure proper setup

### Example: Creating a Goblin Archer

```gdscript
# 1. Create goblin_archer.gd extending BaseCreature
# 2. Set up the NPC:

func _setup_npc():
    creature_type = "GoblinArcher"
    base_scale = 0.9
    abilities = ["shoot_arrow"]
    
    max_health = 25
    current_health = max_health
    move_speed = 140
    damage = 8
    attack_range = 180
    attack_cooldown = 1.2
    attack_type = AttackType.RANGED
    preferred_attack_distance = 160
    
    if taggable:
        taggable.add_tag("Enemy")
        taggable.add_tag("Goblin")
        taggable.add_tag("Ranged")
```

## ðŸ“‹ Guide Philosophy

All guides in this project follow these principles:

1. **OOP First**: Every system uses object-oriented programming
2. **Modularity**: Components are plug-and-play
3. **Future-Proof**: Designed for easy extension
4. **Tag-Based**: Leverages the universal tag system
5. **Well-Documented**: Clear comments and examples

## ðŸ”¥ Recent Updates

### Performance Refactor - Flocking & Controllers (NEW!)
- **Complete flocking optimization**: O(nÂ²) â†’ O(nÂ·k) scaling
- **Authoritative separation**: FlockingSystem is the ONLY source of separation/alignment/cohesion
- **Controller refactor**: Removed all local separation logic from movement controllers
- **Cadence patterns**: Raycasts every N frames, pathfinding on timer
- **Grid-based neighbors**: Replaced global entity scans with spatial grid lookups
- **Single velocity owner**: BaseEntity is the only script that sets velocity
- **New guides created**:
  - Flocking Optimization Guide - Architecture rules and patterns
  - Performance Optimization Guide - Cadence, caching, profiling
  - Movement Controller Guide - Controller patterns and integration
- **Critical changes**:
  - ZombieMovementController no longer has `separation_force` property
  - AIMovementController uses FlockingSystem.get_neighbors()
  - All controllers must use cadence for expensive operations

### Ticket-Based Spawning System with Ramping (UPDATED!)
- **Complete overhaul** of Twitch entity spawning mechanics
- Chatters now type `!join` once per session to participate
- **Ticket pool system**: Each monster type has different ticket values (spawn weights)
  - Twitch Rat: 100 tickets (most common)
  - Succubus: 20 tickets (equal to Joe, was 33)
  - Woodland Joe: 20 tickets
- **Dynamic Monster Power Ramping**:
  - Starts at 0.0 base threshold
  - +0.002 every 1 second (0.12 per minute)
  - +1.0 for each boss defeated (boss bonus)
  - Simple addition: base + time + boss
- **Off-Screen Spawning**: Monsters spawn in 50-300px ring outside camera view
- **Clean UI Display**: 
  - Just the threshold number at top center (grey, 18px font)
  - Always shows 1 decimal place for readability
  - Positioned 60px from top
- **Concurrent spawning**: Same chatter can have multiple monsters alive
- **Commands affect all entities**: !fart, !explode, !boost trigger on ALL chatter's monsters
- **New MXP upgrade**: !ticket command increases spawn chance (3 MXP per use)
- **Session-based**: Resets on game restart, chatters must rejoin

### Boss Updates & AI Improvements
- **Forsen Boss**: Now plays "crashing this plane" dialog when channeling Summon Swarm
- **Ziz Boss Buff Nerf**: Death explosion chance reduced from 50% to 25%
- **Ugandan Warrior Improvements**:
  - Explosion logic moved to SuicideBombAbility (reusable)
  - AI proximity activation pattern documented
  - Size reduced by 30%, base damage reduced to 1

### NPC Implementation Guides Added
- Created comprehensive NPC Entity Implementation Guide
- Added NPC Quick Reference with copy-paste templates
- Created detailed NPC Implementation Checklist
- Documented class hierarchy (BaseCreature vs BaseEvolvedCreature)
- Included movement patterns, aggro systems, and ability integration
- Added common issues and debugging tips

### Death Attribution System Complete
- Fixed critical crash when Resource-based abilities tried to deal damage
- Added Twitch chat colors to death screen for killer names
- Fixed missing ability names in death messages
- Fixed priority bug where entity's default attack overrode ability names
- Updated all damage-dealing entities with proper attribution methods:
  - `explosion_effect.gd` - Now shows correct attacker and "explosion"
  - `base_enemy.gd` - Shows "bite" as default attack
  - `suction_ability.gd` - Uses metadata pattern to show "life drain"
- Comprehensive documentation added covering:
  - Resources cannot be damage sources (only Nodes)
  - `active_ability_name` metadata takes priority over default attacks
  - Proper attribution delegation patterns
  - Signal parameter changes
  - All four attribution patterns with examples

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for LLMs

When using these guides to implement features:

1. **Always check existing patterns** - Consistency is key
2. **Use the templates** - They handle edge cases
3. **Follow the checklist** - It prevents common mistakes
4. **Tag everything** - The tag system is central to interactions
5. **Test edge cases** - Entity death, resource depletion, etc.
