# NEW TICKET-BASED SPAWNING SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## âœ… COMPLETED CHANGES

### 1. **TicketSpawnManager** (`systems/ticket_spawn_manager.gd`)
- Manages the entire ticket-based spawning system
- Handles `!join` command for chatters to enter the monster pool
- Maintains ticket pool with weighted spawning based on monster types
- Continuously spawns monsters to maintain target monster power threshold
- Tracks multiple concurrent entities per chatter

### 2. **GameController Updates** (`game_controller.gd`)
- Removed old spawning logic (spawn on every chat message)
- Removed respawn cooldown system
- Updated command handlers (!explode, !fart, !boost) to work on ALL chatter's entities
- Added `_execute_command_on_all_entities()` helper function
- Integrated TicketSpawnManager initialization
- Added session reset on game start

### 3. **Ticket Modifier** (`systems/mxp_modifiers/modifiers/ticket_modifier.gd`)
- New MXP upgrade: `!ticket` command
- Costs 3 MXP per use
- Increases chatter's ticket count by 10% per stack
- Max 10 stacks (+100% spawn chance)
- Dynamically rebuilds ticket pool when upgraded

### 4. **Entity Updates** (`entities/enemies/twitch_rat.gd`)
- Removed old registration with GameController
- Entities now managed entirely by TicketSpawnManager

## ðŸŽ® HOW THE NEW SYSTEM WORKS

### Joining the Battle
1. Chatters type `!join` once per session to participate
2. They're added to the ticket pool based on their monster type
3. Session resets when game restarts

### Ticket System
- **Rat**: 100 tickets (0.01 power)
- **Succubus**: 33 tickets (0.03 power)  
- **Woodland Joe**: 20 tickets (0.05 power)
- Chatters can use `!ticket` to increase their spawn chance

### Spawning Logic
1. System maintains a target "monster power" (default: 10.0)
2. When total alive power < threshold, draws random tickets
3. Each drawn ticket spawns that chatter's customized monster
4. Same chatter can have multiple monsters alive simultaneously

### Concurrent Commands
- `!fart`, `!explode`, `!boost` now execute on ALL of a chatter's alive monsters
- Each monster has individual cooldowns
- More monsters = more impact!

## ðŸ§ª TESTING CHECKLIST

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Type `!join` in chat - should see "joined the battle!" message
- [ ] Monsters should start spawning automatically after joining
- [ ] Multiple chatters can join and all contribute to spawn pool

### Concurrent Spawning
- [ ] Same chatter can have multiple monsters alive
- [ ] Check monster power display/debug info
- [ ] Verify spawn rate adjusts based on alive monster power

### Commands on Multiple Entities
- [ ] `!fart` triggers on all chatter's alive monsters
- [ ] `!explode` triggers on all chatter's alive monsters
- [ ] `!boost` triggers on all chatter's alive monsters
- [ ] Individual cooldowns work per entity

### MXP Integration
- [ ] `!ticket` command increases spawn chance
- [ ] Ticket pool rebuilds after upgrade
- [ ] Higher ticket count = more frequent spawns

### Session Management
- [ ] Game restart clears all joined chatters
- [ ] Need to `!join` again after restart
- [ ] MXP resets properly

## ðŸ“Š TUNING PARAMETERS

In `TicketSpawnManager`:
- `monster_power_threshold`: Target power level (default: 10.0)
- `spawn_check_interval`: How often to check spawning (default: 0.5s)
- `max_spawn_per_tick`: Max spawns per check (default: 5)

To adjust difficulty:
```gdscript
GameController.instance.set_monster_power_threshold(15.0)  # More monsters
```

## ðŸš€ SYSTEM IS READY FOR TESTING!

The new spawning system is fully implemented and ready to test. The main changes are:
1. No more spawn on every message - use `!join` once
2. No more spawn limits per user - can have multiple monsters
3. No more respawn timers - ticket system controls everything
4. Commands affect ALL your monsters at once
5. Upgrade your spawn rate with `!ticket` MXP command
